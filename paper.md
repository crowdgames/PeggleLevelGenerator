The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and video game design has yielded innovative 
approaches to procedural content generation (PCG). In this paper, we explore a novel method for
 generating video game levels inspired by images. The ability to translate static content into
playable game environments opens up possibilities of reducing costs and time spent on level design.

Traditional methods of level design often require manual effort and extensive time investment from human designers. Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques have emerged as a promising avenue to automate this process. PCG algorithms generate game content algorithmically, offering benefits such as scalability, variety, and adaptability. While numerous PCG approaches exist, our focus lies in leveraging images as a source of inspiration for level generation.

We will be generating Peggle levels, as the game is simple enough to be represented by a single image. Peggle is a puzzle game where the player shoots a ball from the top of the screen, and the ball bounces off pegs and other obstacles until it reaches the bottom of the screen. There are two types of pegs, rectangular and circular. We will refer to the rectangular varient as bricks, and the circular varient as pegs. The layout of the pegs and bricks follows the background image, which is a static image that is displayed behind the level.
